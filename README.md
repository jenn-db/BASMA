# Campaign Performance

I was provided with a dataset in Excel format, which I transformed into CSV and imported into DB Browser. My first step was grouping campaigns based on their names to facilitate a structured overview.

I showcased campaign metrics, including their respective locations (I added the location column by concluding it from the campaign name) and platforms. I also used SQL to show monthly performance trends.

Finally, I integrated the SQL-generated tables into Tableau, and built charts that will help get a view on the campaigns and lead to informed decision making. I also added a PPT presentation to explain my findings based on the dashboard. (I did not attach it because it had confidential information).
